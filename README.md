## Introduction

Air travel is an essential part of modern life, but flight delays can cause significant inconvenience and frustration for passengers. This project aims to analyze airline delay data to gain insights into the factors that contribute to flight delays and to build a machine learning model to predict whether a flight will be delayed or not.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to have Python 3 and the following libraries installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn

You can install these libraries using pip:

```
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn sklearn
```

You will also need to download the [Airline Delay and Cancellation Data, 2009-2018](https://www.kaggle.com/yuanyuwendymu/airline-delay-and-cancellation-data-2009-2018) dataset from Kaggle and save it to the `data` directory.

## Data

The dataset contains information on flights in the United States from 2009 to 2018, including the date, airline, origin and destination airports, scheduled and actual departure and arrival times, and various other features. The dataset is quite large, with over 7 million rows and 31 columns.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The first step in the analysis is to explore the data using various visualization techniques. The distribution of delays is examined, as well as the relationship between delay and distance, the distribution of delays by carrier and origin/destination airports, and other factors that may contribute to delays.

## Feature Engineering

New features are created from the existing data to improve the performance of the machine learning model. For example, the time of day (morning, afternoon, evening, or night) and the distance category (short, medium, or long) are derived from the departure time and distance features.

## Machine Learning Model

A Random Forest Classifier is built to predict whether a flight will be delayed or not based on various features, such as month, day of week, departure time, distance, carrier, origin, and destination. The model is evaluated using cross-validation on the training data, and the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are calculated. The model is then tuned by adjusting the hyperparameters of the Random Forest Classifier to improve its performance. Finally, the model is tested on a holdout dataset to evaluate its performance on new, unseen data.

## Results

The final machine learning model achieved an accuracy of approximately 82% in predicting whether a flight will be delayed or not. The model was built using a Random Forest Classifier and features such as month, day of week, departure time, distance, carrier, origin, and destination.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the use of data analysis and machine learning techniques to gain insights into airline delay data and to build a predictive model. The results of the analysis can be used to inform decisions about scheduling, staffing, and other factors that may contribute to flight delays.
